            // Checkpoint 4.1 What are HTTP requests and reponses? What are the various HTTP verbs and what do they do?
            // Answer: An HTTP request is a procedure that needs to be conducted on a source that is recognized by a 
            // Request-URL. 
            // HTTP responses are status codes that provide information whether an HTTP request has been executed 
            // successfully. 
            // HTTP request methods are also referred to as HTTP verbs. The various HTTP verbs include GET, POST, PUT, 
            // and DELETE. GET returns a single item or a list. POST allows you to create an item. PUT allows you to 
            // update an item. DELETE allows you to remove an item.

            // a different function.
            // The then method specifies the next action after a Promise is resolved. The catch method handles and 
            // catches the errors that occur when a Promise is running.
            // The then method specifies the next action after a Promise is resolved. The catch method handles and 
            // catches the errors that occur when a Promise is running.
            // The await keyword is used to postpone execution before a Promise resolves The try-catch tries to run 
            // a block of code and catches error when it is present.
